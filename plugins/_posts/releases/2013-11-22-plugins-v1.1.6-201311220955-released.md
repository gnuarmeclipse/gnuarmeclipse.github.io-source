The main changes are the improvements done in the templates code.

[Binary files »]({{ page.download_url }})

New features:

* separate template configurations for standalone, retargetting or semihosting
* a local `_sbrk()` was added, to match the definitions in the linker scripts; compared to the one included in newlib, this one:
  * enforces align(4) to avoid alignment problems
  * checks `_Heap_Limit` instead of `SP` (RTOS can allocate it below)
* the libgloss/syscalls.c was included locally, to make the semihosting implementation details explicit and to allow the separate `_sbrk()`.

Bugs fixed:

* [bugs:#66, support-requests:#30] the sections.ld `_end` definition is now based on `_end_noinit` to make the templates compile in Release
* [bugs:#63] updating the toolchain settings for multiple configurations at once is now possible
* [bugs:#65] when using cortex-m4 and float hard or softfp, automatically select fpv4spd16, otherwise the build failed
* [support-requests:#30] the pointers used in the init_array sections are void* to avoid warnings.

Other changes:

* the librdimon linker options were added to the Hello World templates, to make it compile directly
* when using startup files, the DEBUG version of ResetHandler is no longer naked, to allow breakpoints
* since the `__register_exitproc()` provided by newlib seems buggy, add an empty `__register_exitproc()` in startup_cm.c to avoid startup crash when using startup files
* the error processing in `_write_trace_semihosting_stdout()` is more elaborate.
