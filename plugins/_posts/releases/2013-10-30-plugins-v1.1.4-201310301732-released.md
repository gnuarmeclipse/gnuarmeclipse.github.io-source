The main change is **the addition of the STM32F4x template**, that generates a fully configurable running sample, based on the original standard peripheral library (`STM32F4xx_DSP_StdPeriph_Lib_V1.2.0`) from the stsw-stm32065.zip archive.

Other changes since the previous version:

* after the positive experience with the stm32f4x template, the stm32f1x template was adjust to be even closer to the STM standard; so the ldscripts were replaced with original parts from STM archive; the change does not affect compatibility, except the flash start address, that was changed to 0x08000000
* in the stm32f1 template, the semi-hosting link options were removed from Release
* the managedbuild.cross plug-in inits were adjusted to allow the stm32f4x template to set the ARM target options (.family & .instructionset); there should be no compatibility issues.
