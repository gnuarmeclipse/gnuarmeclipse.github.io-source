The main change is **the addition of the STM32F1x template**, that generates a fully configurable running sample, based on the original standard peripheral library (`STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Lib_V3.5.0`) from the stsw-stm32054.zip archive.

Other changes since the previous version:

* Sourcery build tools for windows had wrong names; renamed to **cs-make**, **cs-rm**
* the toolchain path can include macros now, they are properly expanded before being added to the environment
* the “**Include files (-include)**” option was added to all compiler tools, to allow the inclusion of additional files
* the IDs of the options that define the include paths were inconsistent; fixed, now called “**.include.paths**” instead of “*.includepaths” (Warning: this might require an update of the projects created with the previous versions of the plug-in; see the [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/faq/) page)
* the IDs of the options that enable the generation of the assembler listing were inconsistent; fixed, now called “**.asmlisting**” instead of “.lstfilename” (Warning: this might require an update of the projects created with the previous versions of the plug-in)
* in the Settings page, the tools categories previously named _Directories_ are now called _Includes_.
