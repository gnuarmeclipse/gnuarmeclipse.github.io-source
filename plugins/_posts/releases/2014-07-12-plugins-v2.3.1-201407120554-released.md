Version 2.3.1 is a major release. The main addition is an experimental version of the [CMSIS Pack](http://www.keil.com/pack/doc/cmsis/Pack/html/index.html) Installer. The information in these packages will later be used to automatically generate the **linker scripts**, to view **processor registers** during debug sessions and finally to provide the required building blocks for **elaborate templates**.

New features

* a new **Packs perspective** was added; to make it visible, click the toolbar **Packs** button depicting two packages, then click the top right **Refresh** button to download the packages summaries
* [feature-requests:#35] to increase debug configurations portability, the server default definitions  were changed:
  * the J-Link GDB server is defined as `${jlink_path}/${jlink_gdbserver}`
  * the OpenOCD is defined as `${openocd_path}/${openocd_executable}`
  * with all 4 macros having the defaults appropriate for the platform.
* [feature-requests:#57] the preferences for the J-Link and OpenOCD plug-ins were moved to  separate workspace preference files and are no longer cluttering the template defaults.
* [feature-requests:#58] the preferences for the cross build plug-in (mainly the toolchain name and global paths) were moved from the shared template defaults to the global Eclipse preferences, visible to all workspaces
* [feature-requests:#48] support for project-less debugging was added to the J-Link & OpenOCD plug-ins (many thanks to John Moule for the patches).

Bugs fixed

* [bugs:#108] in certain conditions, building shared libraries was problematic; the content of the **Build Artefact** page was fixed.

Other changes

* [feature-requests:#54] to facilitate the integration of the build plug-in in other suites, it is now possible to set a properties file with the default toolchain name and the default paths for several toolchains
* [support:#62] the STM32F4 template was updated to the latest STM libraries; the STM32F411x devices are now supported.
