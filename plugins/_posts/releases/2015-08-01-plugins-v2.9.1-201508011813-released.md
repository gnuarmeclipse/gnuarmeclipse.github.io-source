Version 2.9.1.201508011813 is a new release; the main improvement is the new version of the [GNU ARM Eclipse QEMU]({{ site.baseurl }}/qemu) emulator (including a graphical LED emulator), paired with a new version of the QEMU Debugging plug-in; also embedded applications can now be executed in Run mode, not only in Debug mode.

## New features

* [GNU ARM Eclipse QEMU 2.2.92-20150404*-dev released]({{ site.baseurl }}/2015/04/05/qemu-v2-2-92-20150404-released/); 
  ![The STM32F4-Discovery 4 LEDs.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2015/board-stm32f4-discovery-leds.png)
* [GNU ARM Eclipse Build Tools 2.6-20150715* released](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/windows-build-tools/wiki/Release-v2.6-20150715); 
* a new version of the **QEMU Debugging plug-in** was added; the board and device definitions are copied from the project CMSIS configuration, if available; 
  ![The QEMU Debugger tab.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2015/launch-qemu-debugger.png)
* [feature-requests:#104] all debug launch configurations can also be started in **Run mode**; the difference is that breakpoint support is disabled, so execution will proceed without halting in breakpoints; 
  ![Accessing QEMU Run configurations.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2015/menu-run-qemu.png)
* [feature-requests:#95] support for new ARM architectures (**arm7ve**, **armv8-a+crc**) and CPUs (**cortex-a12**, **cortex-m0.small-multiply**, **cortex-m0plus.small-multiply**, **cortex-m1.small-multiply**) was added; to match the capabilities of GCC 4.9;
* support for **editing the toolchain path** for any supported toolchain was added; previously only the default toolchain path was editable; 
  ![Global toolchain path editor.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2015/preferences-c-build-global-tools-paths.png)
* support for **configuring the toolchain for non-managed projects** was added; previously the indexer for non-managed projects could not be configured to match the actual build configuration;
  ![The simplified settings for makefile projects.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2015/properties-c-settings-make.png)
* [support-requests:#155] the STM32F4 template was updated to use **HAL v1.6**;
* the **STM32F446xx** was added to the STM32F4 template;
* the QEMU build script was updated to use Docker; the build procedure was extended to download most of the required libraries and build them from sources.
                    
## Addressed bugs

* [bugs:#188] the **CMSIS Packs Manager**  failed to download from Nordic URLs, which redirected to another server; the download code was improved to process HTTP redirects;
* [bugs:#186] non relevant setting are no longer shown in non-manged projects;
* [bugs:#184] editing the path for other toolchains than the default one was not possible; added.
                    
## Template issues
                    
* [feature-requests:#97] the **VTOR register** is now explicitly set during initialisations, to be sure it matches the address of the vectors;
* in the **blinky** projects, the first cycle is a full second with the LED turned on, as a visual feedback that the LED polarity is configured correctly.
                    
## Known problems
                    
* none so far
