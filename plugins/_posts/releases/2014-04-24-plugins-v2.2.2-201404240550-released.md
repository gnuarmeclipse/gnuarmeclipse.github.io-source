Version 2.2.2-201404240550 is a maintenance release.

It was issued to correct the following bugs:

* [bugs:#104]: Allocate console for OpenOCD kept grey on Windows; due to a bug in the Windows build of OpenOCD, the executable cannot run without a console, so on Windows it is not possible to  disable the OpenOCD console window;
* [bugs:#105]: GNU Linker Error Parser added to C/C++ link tools; the linker error parser was missing from the linker tools, so linker errors were not recognised as errors and no links to the project files were possible; fixed.

In addition, the following changes were applied to the development environment:

* in preparation for Eclipse 4.4 Luna, the JDK was switched to version 7
* the version of the maven plug-in used for builds (tycho) was updated to 0.20.0.

Except building slightly faster, these changes should have no functional impact on the plug-ins.

Finally, after being marked as ‘end-of-life’ in the past 6 months, the venerable 0.5.5.x plug-in was retired from the update site; it can still be downloaded as an archive from the SourceForge Files section, but is not recommended for new projects.
