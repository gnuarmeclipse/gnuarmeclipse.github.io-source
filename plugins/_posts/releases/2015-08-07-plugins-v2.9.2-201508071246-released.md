Version 2.9.2-201508071246 is a maintenance release; the main improvements include support for multi-LED boards in the STM32F4 C++ template and more elaborate PLL settings in the STM32F4 templates.

New features:

  * the STM32F4 template was extended to generate projects that can blink **multiple LEDs**, with special focus on the **STM32F4-Discovery** board, which features 4 user LEDs; this project is now the default test project, and can be easily **tested on QEMU** which fully support this board.

In the projects generated by the templates, the following issues were addressed:

  * [bugs:#193] the `_initialize\_hardware()` always set **VTOR**, which does not exist on small Cortex-M0/M0+ cores; the setting is now conditioned by `__ARM_ARCH_7M__`;
  * since for HAL projects it is mandatory to have the **SysTick** running at 1000 Hz, the call to `HAL_IncTick()` was added to al templates, conditionally included by `USE_HAL_DRIVER`;
  * [feature-requests:#67] the HAL function name to set the clock is `SystemClock_Config()`; the `configure_system_clock()` function was renamed `SystemClock_Config()`, defined as weak, to allow it be redefined in CubeMX projects;
  * [feature-requests:#67] the PLL logic for STM32F4 was improved, to be specific to each device; small devices use max 84 MHz, the rest max 168 MHz; this setting is conservative, although the maximum speed is higher, it was preferred in order to keep the USB functional;
  * [support-requests:#155] ]support for boards that do not use external clock but only internal RC oscillator was added; just define the clock frequency (HSE) to 0 in the template wizard and the clock initialisations will use the HSI.
