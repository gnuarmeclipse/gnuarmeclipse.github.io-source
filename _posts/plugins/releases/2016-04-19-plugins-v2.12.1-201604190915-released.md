## New features

* thanks to a contribution from Chris Reed and John Cortell, a new debugging plug-in was added, to facilitate the integration of pyOCD with Eclipse.
* add support for CMSIS Packs SVD schema version 1.4 (add properties access & alias)
* [[pull:#96](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/pull/96)/[#94](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/94) & [pull:#99](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/pull/99)/[#95](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/95)] add support for `file:///path` URLs to access local packs repositories

## Addressed bugs

* [[pull:#91](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/pull/91)/[#90](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/90)] in certain conditions, the Apply button in the Toolchains tab did not save the page content; fixed.
* [[pull:#107](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/pull/107)/[#106](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/106)] in certain conditions, after removing a plug-in implementing a specific toolchain, the Settings page became invalid and could not be opened; fixed, in order to fix the project configuration, now the settings page opens for projects having non-existing toolchains.
