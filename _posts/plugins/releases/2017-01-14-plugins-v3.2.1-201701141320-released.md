## New features

* the `-march=` option was extended to include `armv8-m.base`, `armv8-m.main`, `armv8-m.main+dsp` (from GCC 5.4)
* the `-mcpu=` option was extended to include `cortex-a72`, `cortex-r8`, `exynos-m1`, `xgene1` (from GCC 5.4)
* the fields to configure the compiler standard were extended up to `-std=c++1z`
* the field to configure the C++ ABI version was extended to support version 7, 8 and 9 (from GCC 5.4)
* the field to configure the debug information was extended to support the  version dwarf-5 (currently experimental in GCC 5.4)

## Addressed bugs

* [[#156](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/156)] the second update of **Neon (4.6.2)** introduced a new implementation for the GDB consoles, slightly incompatible with previous versions, which prevented the debug sessions to start on Windows; with a little help from the CDT developpers, a solution to create the GDB server consoles was found, such that the debug plug-ins start properly an Neon.2 too;
* [[#145](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/145)] in certain conditions, installing an older version of a CMSIS Pack failed; the problem was identified to be related to cache management; fixed;
* [[#126](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/126)] in certain conditions, the folders entered in the Eclipse preferences pages **Global Tools Paths** and **Workspace Tools Paths** were not validated; thanks to a patch provided by John Moule, this problem was fixed;
* [[#125](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/125)] in certain conditions, the folders entered in the project properties page **Tools Paths** were not validated; thanks to a patch provided by John Moule, this problem was fixed;
* [[#108](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/108)] in certain conditions, the **Enable flash breakpoints** button did not function properly; thanks to a patch provided by John Cortell, this problem was fixed;
* in certain conditions, refreshing packs with bad PDSC files terminated the refresh process and subsequent packs were not refreshed; a more elaborate error processing was implemented, errors are logged and all packs are now refreshed;
* in certain conditions, the J-Link/OpenOCD,QEMU debugging plug-ins  validated the server fields even when the server was not started; fixed;

## Template changes

* the stm32f0 template was updated to use StdPerip V1.5.0
* the stm32f0 template was extended to support 030xC, 070x6, 070xB, 091
* the stm32f4 template was updated to use Cube HAL v1.12.0
* the stm32f4 template was extended to support 412Cx, 412Rx, 412Vx, 412Zx

### Other changes

* for consistency reasons, the compiler tools names were slightly changed to include GNU (for example **Cross ARM GNU C Compiler**)

## Known problems

* none.
