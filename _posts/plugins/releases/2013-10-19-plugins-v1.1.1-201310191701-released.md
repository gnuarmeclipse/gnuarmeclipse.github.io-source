Version 1.1.1.201310191701 is a maintenance release.

Changes since the previous version:

* the type of the configuration field used to store the linker scripts was changed from single string to string list, to allow multiple linker scripts
* a new toolchain, named _Custom_ was added, to be used for testing custom template configurations
* a new C template was added to generate functional Cortex-M3 semi-hosting projects

[Binary files »]({{ page.download_url }})

Please note that although the linker script update maintains compatibility with previous version, and old projects still work, it is recommended to update them to the new format. For this, close the Eclipse and manually edit the .cproject file to remove lines containing

	<option id="ilg.gnuarmeclipse.managedbuild.cross.option.c.linker.scriptfile.NNNNNNN" ... >

then start Eclipse and configure the scripts again in the Settings page.
