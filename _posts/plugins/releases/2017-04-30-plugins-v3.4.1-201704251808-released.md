Version 3.4.1-201704251808 is a maintenance release, intended to update the plugins to the new CMSIS Packs specs and to also fix some bugs.

## New features

* [[Issue:#199](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/199)] starting with CMSIS Packs specs v1.4.8, ARM/Keil defined the format of the packs index as an `index.pidx` file; the previous undocumented `index.idx` file was deprecated; the plug-ins were upgraded and for new installs they default to the new `index.pidx` file; for existing workspaces, it is recommended to manually update the URL to `http://www.keil.com/pack/index.pidx` in the Preferences page **C/C++** → **Packages**;
* [[Issue:#200](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/200)] starting with CMSIS Packs specs v1.4.8, the version fields can use the [semver](http://semver.org) syntax; the parser was updated to support this new syntax and the packages are now ordered correctly when displaying the package list;
* [[Issue:#137](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/137)] to help identify possible syntax errors while processing the XML files, the location where the error occured was added to the errors generated by the XML parser.

## Addressed bugs

* [[Issue:#155](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/155)] and [[Issue:#157](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/157)]: the lexycographic rule used to order versions was not appropriate, since versions like 1.10 were after 1.1, not after 1.9; the migration to semver also fixed this problem and the packages are ordered as expected;
* [[Issue:#150](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/150)] for SVDs using register clusters, the `<addressOffset>` element was erroneously ignored and the resulting register addresses were wrong; fixed, clusters and arrays do recursively add offsets on the way up to the top;
* [[Issue:#144](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/144)] in certain conditions, scrolling the content of the debugger configuration tabs did not work as expected; the logic behind the Debugger and Startup tabs was updated to exhibit the same scrollong behaviour as the Main tab;
* [[Issue:#25](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/25)] due to a bug, when multiple versions of a package were installed at the same time, they erroneously contributed multiple entries of the list of devices, boards and books; the code was fixed and duplicate records are now avoided.

## Template changes

* [[Issue:#183](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/183)] although support for the new M23 & M33 cores was added in the previous release, the project wizard was not able to use them; the wizard was updated to the full list;
* a copyright lawyer detected some possible ambiguous issues related to the code generated by the project wizards; to avoid such legal issues, the license of the C/C++ source files was changed to an explicit MIT license;
* [[Issue:#153](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/153)] the `raise()` & `kill()` functions generated for semihosting configurations were marked as `weak` to alow redefinition;
* [[Issue:#159](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/159)] the configurations created by the project wizards included tracing definitions even for the Release configurations; these definitions were removed, and `NDEBUG` was explicitly added to Release configurations to disable asserts.

### Other changes

* the update sites are currently migrated from SourceForge to [Bintray](https://bintray.com/gnuarmeclipse/updates); the public URL remains the same (`http://gnuarmeclipse.sourceforge.net/updates`) and will be automatically redirected to the new server; the full transition is expected to be complete by May 1st, 2017;
* the build scripts were updated to use SHA to compute the checksums for the generated binaries.

## Known problems

* none.
