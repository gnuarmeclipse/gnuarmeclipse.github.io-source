## New features

* [[#32](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/32)] the Cortex-M7 specific FPU definitions `fpv5-d16` & `fpv5-sp-d16` were added to the Settings page;
* [[#33](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/33)] the toolchain prefix for **GCC 4.9 Linaro AArch64 bare-metal ELF** was updated from `aarch64-none-elf-` to `aarch64-elf-`; the change is effective for newly created projects; old projects require to reselect the toolchain for the update to be effective.

* none.

## Template issues

* in certain conditions, the linker complained about a missing symbol (`__dso_handle`); added as weak to `_syscalls.c`.

### Other changes

## Known problems

* none so far.
