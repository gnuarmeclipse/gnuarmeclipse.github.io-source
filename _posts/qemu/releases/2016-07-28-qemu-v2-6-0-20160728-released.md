Version 2.6.0-201607280535 is a stable release, adding support for BASEPRI, in order for RTOSes (like FreeRTOS, [µOS++ IIIe / CMSIS++](http://micro-os-plus.github.io)) to properly implement critical sections.

## Addressed issues

- [Issue:[#21](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/qemu/issues/21)] in the original QEMU, the Cortex-M3/M4/M7 `BASEPRI` register was ignored when processing interrupts, so it was not possible to implement critical sections by manipulating `BASEPRI`; fixed.
- [Issue:[#13](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/qemu/issues/13)] in certain conditions, writing a half word was not effective; fixed.
- in the original QEMU, the **CoreDebug** registers were not implemented; added, with minimal functionality; in the `DHCSR` register, the `C_DEBUGEN` bit is set to 1 if the program runs under the GDB server.
- [Issue:[#23](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/qemu/issues/23)] make the `BKPT` instruction interrupt the CPU while in DEBUG
- [Issue:[#20](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/qemu/issues/20)] The special registered were not visible in the GDB server list; `MSP`, `PSP`, `PRIMASK`, `BASEPRI`, `FAULTMASK`, `CONTROL` were added.
- [Issue:[#19](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/qemu/issues/19)] in certain conditions, the resetting the peripheral registers was not effective; fixed.
- add reset for all USARTs on the STM32 devices.
- [Issue:[#9](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/qemu/issues/9)] the LEDs on the OLIMEX STM32-P107 board were swapped; fixed.
