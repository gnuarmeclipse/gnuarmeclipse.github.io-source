## Overview

The **[GNU ARM Eclipse project](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse)** includes a set of open source Eclipse plug-ins and tools to create/build/debug/manage **ARM** (32-bits) and **AArch64** (64-bits) applications and static/shared libraries, using the latest **GNU ARM GCC** toolchains. 

## ARM family and FPU type

Starting with GNU ARM Eclipse version 2.10.2, from November 2015, full Cortex-M7 support was added to the **C/C++ Build** → **Settings** → **Tool Settings** page; it is now possible not only to select the **ARM family**: **cortex-m7**, but also to select the new specific **FPU type**:

## The Hello World Cortex-M C/C++ Project wizard

The project wizard was updated to create generic Cortex-M7 projects.

## The STM32F7xx C/C++ Project wizard

And last, but probably the most useful, a new template to create STM32F7 projects was added.

The wizard currently supports STM32F745xx, STM32F746xx, STM32F756xx, and can create blinky projects for the STM32F746_EVAL and STM32F746_DISCOVERY boards.

The created projects not only pass the build, but are ready to run on the selected boards.
