## Goals

The forum goal was to facilitate experience sharing between GNU ARM Eclipse users and as a place to post questions and support requests. In case a problem is identified as bug or feature request, please use the corresponding GitHub Issues [tracker](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/).

## Access

The forum URL is:

`https://www.element14.com/community/groups/gnu-arm-eclipse`

The forum type is open, and anyone can contribute. Access is free, based on registration.

## Start a discussion

The element14 Community Group is actually more than a simple forum, it is also a blog, it can manage polls, calendar events, and many more.

For common usage, to start a new discussion, use the top right link _Start a discussion_.

## No support for markdown

Unfortunatelly the Jive powered server currently has no support for markdown, so follow the server formatting rules.

## Categories

The GNU ARM Eclipse Group is also home for discussions related to other subprojects, like CMSIS++, ÂµOS++, and xPacks.

Please be sure you select the **GNU ARM Eclipse** category.

## Mark your questions as Answered

If you receive the expected answer, please let the server know this, for an efficient way to manage the issues.
